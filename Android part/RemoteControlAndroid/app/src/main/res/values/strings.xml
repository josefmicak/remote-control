    <string name="indicator_lights">The page contains two <font color='cyan'>cyan</font> indicator lights.
        The lights briefly turn <font color='green'>green</font> if an action is successful and <font color='red'>red</font> if an action is unsuccessful.
        The first light checks whether the key press has been successfully sent.
        This is mostly useful on the smart watch because they don\'t require uninterrupted internet connection to function.
        The second light checks whether the key press has been successfully performed.
        This doesn\'t happen in case the desktop part is not currently running. </string>
